    <p>I grew up traveling the world with my family, Grew up Outside Chicago & Cronulla Beach Australia. After High
      School I joined the US Marine Corps where I was a CBRN Defense Specialist. I was stationed at a special react unit
      outside DC where I was attached to the Recon Platoon. Eventually I became a Recon Team Leader and Went to Nuclear
      weapons school in Kirtland AFB in Albuquerque NM. My Unit Traveled all over the Country and all over the world
      doing Training and Operations dealing with CBRN Threats, Defense, Consequence Management & Analysis. I also worked
