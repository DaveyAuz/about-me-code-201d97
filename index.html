    <p>I grew up traveling the world with my family, Grew up Outside Chicago & Cronulla Beach Australia. After High
      School I joined the US Marine Corps where I was a CBRN Defense Specialist. I was stationed at a special react unit
      outside DC where I was attached to the Recon Platoon. Eventually I became a Recon Team Leader and Went to Nuclear

      doing Training and Operations dealing with CBRN Threats, Defense, Consequence Management & Analysis. I also worked
